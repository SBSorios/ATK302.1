<h1><center>Sword Brother Sorios</center></h1>
<p><center>I am Sorios of the Sword Brethren fighting under the banner of Imperium of Man. I am warrior of the Adeptus Astartes, of the Black Templar Chapter.

My Chapter is a Crusading force of genetically engineered warriors that live only to serve with the undying loyalty to the Emperor, to expand the borders of the Imperium of Man, and wage our wars against the monstrous xenos (aliens) that infest the galaxy, and smite the heretics who dared to side with the forces of Chaos, both that obstruct Mankind's destiny to ascend into great glory.

We are the Space Marines, and we shall know no fear!</center><p/>
